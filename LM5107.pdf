The LM5107 is a low cost high voltage gate driver,
designed to drive both the high side and the low side
N-Channel MOSFETs in a synchronous buck or a
half bridge configuration. The floating high-side driver
is capable of working with rail voltages up to 100-V.
The outputs are independently controlled with TTL
compatible input thresholds. An integrated on chip
high voltage diode is provided to charge the high side
gate drive bootstrap capacitor. A robust level shifter
technology operates at high speed while consuming
low power and providing clean level transitions from
the control input logic to the high side gate driver.
Undervoltage lockout is provided on both the low side
and the high side power rails. The device is available
in the SOIC and the thermally enhanced WSON
packages.
